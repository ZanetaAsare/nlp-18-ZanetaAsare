Tyler perry's acrimony is probably one of the most serious, entertaining, and fun to watch. I can see that he really worked hard one this one, especially with hiring Taraji P. Henson, a really good actress.
Ambitious and deeply flawed
It's a Tyler Perry film, so no surprises there, but apparently Taraji P. Henson didn't understand she can do better.
Classic movie!
I'm not sure the movie knows what it wants to say
